# Math Game
## Summary
-- Developed a math game while following the isntruction from coding artist on youtube and I hope to develop a better user experience and interfaces in the future. The game accepts user input which might be a number or three math operators which are "*", "+", "-". If the user input the right answer the game will give a yippie message and the user can restart the game again. if the answer is wrong , the game  will give a opps message, the user can also restart the game again.
